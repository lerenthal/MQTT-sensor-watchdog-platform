# Changelog

All notable changes to the MQTT Sensor Watchdog Platform, ordered newest first.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning follows the date-stamped tag convention (`YYYY-MM-DD`); there
is no SemVer for this project.

## Unreleased

### Added
- `docs/` set with install, configuration, operations, user-guide,
  security, architecture, development.
- Per-sensor drilldown on the dashboard (`▸`/`▾` toggle per device row).
- CSV-driven sensor metadata (`device_id,location,role`) with full
  upload history at `/admin/sensors/history`.
- SQLite WAL mode + 5s busy-timeout to eliminate contention between
  MQTT thread, watchdog scheduler, and Flask handlers.
- Per-table checksum of schema_version inside `schema_meta`.
- New env-var overrides for secrets (`WATCHDOG_MQTT_BROKER` and friends).

### Changed
- Topic parser handles the actual facility shape
  (`sensor/<name>/state`) rather than an initial guess of
  (`sensor_<n>/<metric>/state`).
- `sensor_readings` was renamed from `(device_id, sensor_id, ...)` to
  `(device_id, sensor_name, ...)` to match the actual data model.
- Dashboard table gained new columns: **Location/Role**, **Sensors**
  (with drilldown), sortable headers, search box.
- Passwords are upgraded to salted sha256 hashes on first container
  start and removed from `config.yaml`. The bundled commit only carries
  `CHANGE_ME` placeholders.

### Fixed
- MQTT silent death after broker restart (now has an explicit Telegram
  alarm after 60s of downtime).
- `database is locked` errors from concurrent writers.
- MQTT callback data leak (used to include the SQLite row ID; now
  matches the spec's `ack:<device_id>` / `snooze:<hours>:<device_id>`).
- Snooze button resolved **all** open alerts of a device instead of
  the silenced fault type.

## 2026-10-21 — Initial public release

Initial commit. Flask + MQTT + watchdog + Telegram + dashboard in a
single Python process, packaged in Docker Compose. Schema v1
(`devices`, `alerts`, `audit_logs`).
